-------------------------------------------------
--       The teleportation manifesto begin
-------------------------------------------------
-- This is now on a webpage.

-- A common task is to teleport from point A to point B,
-- and possibly teleport back if there is a problem.
-- Here is the process to do this.

-- Step 1: Get the block path and lbp of where we
-- want to teleport to.
-- We can even work with an "offset" into the
-- target chunk rather than an lbp (local block position).

-- Step 2: Call the following functions:
-- A) ga_move_set_body_spirit()
-- B) ga_explore_while(lua_func, lua_win)
-- C) ga_tele(block_path, offset)
-- Note: these must be called within the SAME frame.

-- Changing our body to "sprit" will make us not
-- collide with the world.  It also makes us
-- not render the WORLD.
-- It also makes teleportation faster because
-- "we do not explore as much".
-- The basic reason why it is so fast is because the following:
-- If the chunk_id of the player is different from what it was
-- last frame, then the engine effectively sets the level
-- radius of each level to 0.
-- The player needs to be at a chunk for at least
-- two frames in order for the engine to create chunks
-- AROUND the viewer's chunk.
-- So, spirit mode is ideal for "drilling down".

-- For the ga_explore_while function call,
-- we pass the (string) name of a Lua function that
-- functions as a "while loop".  That is, the function
-- is called over and over again until it returns false.
-- However, this might not have the purpose that
-- might expect, which we will explain later.
-- You also pass to the ga_explore_while the
-- (string) name of a Lua window which is rendered
-- and gets input even frame until the while loop
-- function return false.

-- The ga_tele function call actually causes
-- the teleportation to happen, which we explain
-- in the next step.

-- Step 3: Wait.
-- Because you called ga_tele, the engine will
-- gradually modify the chunk tree to move the
-- player to the target block path.
-- While this is happening, the engine renders
-- a loading screen and does not actually call
-- any Lua function of the package.
-- This may take a few seconds.

-- Step 4: The engine will finish the teleportation
-- and will begin to call Lua code again.
-- The player is now "in the target chunk",
-- but they are in spirit mode, so they do not
-- really have a body exactly.
--
-- Because you had called the
-- ga_explore_while function, instead of calling
-- normal game functions, the engine will
-- call the "while loop" function you registed
-- using the ga_explore_while.
-- It will also call the input and render functions
-- of the (optional) window you passed to the
-- ga_explore_while function.

-- Step 5: At this point, the game will be in
-- the "while loop".
-- What is the purpose of this loop?
-- Well, you need to make sure it is safe to
-- teleport to this chunk.
-- What if it is completely filled with
-- solid blocks?  What if you wanted to teleport
-- to a waypoint, but somehow there are no
-- waypoints in the chunk?
-- What you want to do is query the chunk of the
-- player to see if it is suitable.
-- You might think you can just do this check
-- in a single frame.  Maybe you can.
-- However if the player's normal body size is
-- more than one block tall, there is an issue
-- that the player's destination would have them
-- partially in this chunk but also spill over
-- to an adjacent chunk.
-- Since we were in spirit mode,
-- there might not be any adjacent chunks to the
-- player's chunk that are loaded!
-- We must wait a few frames from the engine to
-- load nearby chunks for us to assess whether
-- it is really safe to end the teleportation
-- process.
-- Once we have enough information,
-- we need to return "fase" from the while loop function.
-- Just before we do return false,
-- we need to do a few things.

-- Step 6: If we calculated that the destination
-- chunk is OK, we need to do the following:
-- A) Call ga_move_set_body_spirit_off()
--    This will reset the player's body mode and dimensions
--    to what they were just before we called
--    ga_move_set_body_spirit()
-- B) We could move the player slightly within the chunk.
--    Theoretically, we could teleport the player
--    to an adjacent chunk (on the same level)
--    with the ga_tele_same_level function.
--    However, it might be bast to keep things
--    simple and only do A.
-- We are now done!

-- Step 7: Suppose we could not do Step 7 because
-- we calculated that the destination chunk is NOT ok.
-- We are now in trouble!!!
-- Theoretically you could do whatever you want,
-- like display an error screen to the player that says
-- "bummer dude" and then kill the player and take away
-- all their ammo.
-- However what you probably want to do is teleport
-- the player back to where they started before the
-- teleportation.
-- To do this, first note that the player is
-- still in spirit mode.
-- You want to call the ga_tele function
-- but giving it the path and lbp of where the player
-- started.  So, you needed to record this information
-- at the beginning.  You could store it in a "global"
-- variable for example.
-- Next, you MIGHT want to do another ga_explore_while
-- call.  Indeed, you could have chosen not to
-- end the old while loop.  In this case after the
-- engine teleports you back to your starting position,
-- the engine will continue calling this while loop.
-- However one could argue that doing any sort of
-- while loop for the back teleportation
-- (either part of the original while loop or a second one)
-- is not needed: the teleportation back SHOULD succeed.

-- Step 8: If the teleportation BACK does not succeed,
-- you need to decide what is the right thing to do.
-- Perhaps you should teleport the player to their
-- current respawn point.
-- We are now done!

-- Note: If you have an explore_while loop
-- where the function is called many times,
-- you may consider having the function call
-- ga_render_skip_next_frame to pause rendering.
-- This is done for blue rings, and it speeds up
-- the teleportation by a factor of 3 or so.
-- However, since we are using the ga_tele function,
-- it does not really matter.

-- Note: It might make sense for the ga_tele
-- function to record the player's starting path and lbp
-- before the teleportation, that way the player can
-- call a function called something like "ga_tele_back"
-- to have the engine teleport them back to
-- their starting position.
